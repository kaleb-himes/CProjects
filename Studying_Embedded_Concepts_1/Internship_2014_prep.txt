Following is some material I will be reading over the next week in preparation
for summer internship 2014, and potential full time job upon graduation if I am
a good fit for the position.

"DEVELOPING EMBEDDED SOFTWARE IN C USING ICC11/ICC12/METROWERKS"

I just came across some more interesting reading material while search for another
term in the above document. Most of this I already understood but some of it was 
new information and very enlightening to me.
